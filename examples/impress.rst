    Aren't you just bored with all those slides-based presentations?


.. slide-3d::
    :class: step slide
    :x: 0

    Don't you think that presentations given in modern browsers shouldn't
    copy the limits of 'classic' slide decks?


.. slide-3d::

.. slide-3d::
    :id: title
    :class: step
    :x: 0
    :y: 0

    :id: its
    :class: step
    :x: 850

    It's a presentation tool 
    inspired by the idea behind prezi.com
